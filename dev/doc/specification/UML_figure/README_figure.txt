Software diagram edition

For violet.html extension
Figure which have violet.html extension are edited with the software violet uml available on the following website http://alexdp.free.fr/violetumleditor/page.php. You just need Java Run Environment available on http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.

The process to import your figure in your .tex document with violet uml is : 
-Save your source with the extension violet.html
-Export with the software .png
-Then export your .png on .pdf
-You can now import your figure with .pdf extension on your latex document

Known issue :
Violet uml is buggy when you open an existing source, the extends relation & include are plain relation that means no more dotted arrow.

***TODO***
Maybe use an other software to replace violet UML.
