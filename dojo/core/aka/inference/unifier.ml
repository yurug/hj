(** This module implements unification of (ranked) multi-equations
    over a row algebra, that is, an algebra obtained by extending a
    free algebra [A] with rows.

    For the purposes of this module, a rank is an element of an
    arbitrary total order. A rank is associated with every
    multi-equation. When two multi-equations are merged, the smaller
    rank is kept.

    It is understood that finite and infinite terms are legal -- no
    occur check is performed here. *)

   is, it adds the equation [v1 = v2] to the constraint which it
   maintains, then rewrites it in a number of ways until an
   inconsistency is found or a solved form is reached. If the
   former, then [Inconsistency] is raised.
